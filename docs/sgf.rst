The ``sgf`` (Smart Game Format) Module
======================================

.. Note:: the Sente SGF parser is currently highly specialized and ignores lots of data included in SGF files including messages and metadata.

The ``sente.sgf`` module contains functions for parsing SGF (Smart Game Format) Files.
SGF is a standard encoding for go games that is capable of encoding "forked" go games in addition to a raw sequence of moves.
SGF files can be viewed in programs like `CGoban <https://www.gokgs.com/download.jsp>`_ or `Sabaki <https://sabaki.yichuanshen.de>`_.

Loading Games
-------------

SGF files can be loaded into sente using the ``sgf.load`` function.
``sgf.load`` returns a ``sente.Game`` object with a move tree that has been populated with the game tree in the SGF file.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sente import sgf
    >>> game = sgf.load("Lee Sedol ladder game.sgf")
    >>>

When sente loads an SGF file, it does not play out the sequence of moves in the game.
It populates It's internal game tree with the moves played but it does not actually play them on the board.
This means that after the game is loaded, the game will still have an empty board.
However, if the ``get_children`` method is called we can see that the opening move will be populated

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(game)
    >>>
